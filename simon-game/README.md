# Simon Game

Simon is a classic electronic game of memory skill. The game consists of four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
